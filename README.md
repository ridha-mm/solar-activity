# Distribution of Sunspots and Coronal holes
A summary of the project can be found here: https://teamsolaris.sserd.org/services.html

Note: I have lost the files required for coronal-holes-distribution.ipynb notebook. But it is easy to recreate them from the files in the coronal-holes-data folder by yourself.
